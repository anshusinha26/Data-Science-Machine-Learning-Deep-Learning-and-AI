# ⬜️ Model selection

## 🔹 k-Fold Cross Validation

This repository contains an example implementation of k-Fold Cross Validation in a Jupyter Notebook.

### Overview

k-Fold Cross Validation is a resampling technique used in machine learning to evaluate the performance and generalization ability of a model. It involves splitting the dataset into k subsets or folds, training the model on k-1 folds, and evaluating it on the remaining fold. This process is repeated k times, with each fold serving as the test set once. The results from each iteration are then averaged to obtain an overall performance metric for the model.

### Implementation

The notebook K_fold_cross_validation.ipynb demonstrates the application of k-Fold Cross Validation on a dataset using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. The steps involved in the implementation are as follows:

1. Importing the required libraries: This includes numpy, matplotlib, and pandas for data manipulation and visualization.

2. Importing the dataset: The dataset (in this case, Social_Network_Ads.csv) is imported using pandas. The features are assigned to the variable X, and the target variable is assigned to the variable Y.

3. Splitting the dataset: The dataset is split into training and test sets using the train_test_split function from scikit-learn. The training set is used for model training, while the test set is used for evaluation.

4. Feature Scaling: The feature variables are scaled using the StandardScaler from scikit-learn to ensure that they are on a similar scale.

5. Training the Kernel SVM model: The Support Vector Machine (SVM) model with a radial basis function (RBF) kernel is trained on the training set using the SVC class from scikit-learn.

6. Making the Confusion Matrix: The performance of the trained model is evaluated using the confusion matrix and the accuracy score from scikit-learn.

7. Applying k-Fold Cross Validation: The cross_val_score function from scikit-learn is used to perform k-Fold Cross Validation on the training set. The accuracy scores from each iteration are computed and the mean and standard deviation of the scores are printed.

8. Visualizing the results: The training set and test set results are visualized using matplotlib. The decision boundary of the SVM model is plotted along with the data points, allowing for visual inspection of the model's performance.

### Usage

To run the notebook, you will need Jupyter Notebook installed. You can open the notebook in Jupyter and execute the code cells sequentially.

Make sure to have the Social_Network_Ads.csv file in the same directory as the notebook or provide the correct path to the dataset file in the code.

## 🔹 Grid Search

This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates the implementation of Grid Search, a technique used to find the best combination of hyperparameters for a machine learning model. In this example, we use the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm with an RBF kernel to classify the Social Network Ads dataset.

### Importing the libraries

The necessary libraries, including numpy, matplotlib, and pandas, are imported at the beginning of the notebook.

### Importing the dataset

The Social Network Ads dataset is imported using pandas. The dataset is then divided into the feature matrix X and the target vector Y.

### Splitting the dataset into the Training set and Test set

The dataset is split into training and test sets using the train_test_split function from the sklearn.model_selection module. The training set consists of 75% of the data, while the remaining 25% is allocated to the test set.

### Feature Scaling

Feature scaling is performed using the StandardScaler class from the sklearn.preprocessing module. This step ensures that all features are on a similar scale, which is important for SVM algorithms.

### Training the Kernel SVM model on the Training set

The SVM model with an RBF kernel is instantiated and trained on the training set using the SVC class from the sklearn.svm module.

### Making the Confusion Matrix

The trained model is used to make predictions on the test set, and the confusion matrix and accuracy score are computed using functions from the sklearn.metrics module.

### Applying k-Fold Cross Validation

The k-Fold Cross Validation technique is applied to evaluate the model's performance. The cross_val_score function from the sklearn.model_selection module is used to calculate the accuracy scores for the model using 10-fold cross-validation.

### Applying Grid Search to find the best model and the best parameters

Grid Search is performed to find the best combination of hyperparameters for the SVM model. The GridSearchCV class from the sklearn.model_selection module is used, and a parameter grid is specified containing different values for the regularization parameter C, kernel types, and gamma values for the RBF kernel. The best accuracy score and corresponding best parameters are printed.

### Visualizing the Training set and Test set results

The results of the SVM model are visualized using matplotlib. Separate plots are created to show the decision boundaries on the training set and test set. The data points are color-coded based on their actual class, and the decision boundary is plotted.

Note: This readme assumes that the dataset file 'Social_Network_Ads.csv' is present in the same directory as the notebook. Please make sure to adjust the file path if needed.
